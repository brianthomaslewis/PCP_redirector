# Healthcare Member Engagement: Practicum Project

## Background

Our practicum partner is a large health insurance company (LHIC) operating in the United
States across several states. LHIC employs a care
management team to engage with high-risk individuals covered under its plans. This team
is tasked with helping its high-risk member population make healthier choices, obtain
lower-cost help from local health providers before problems become more urgent, and
maintain medication regimens. Their goal is to prevent this population from suffering from
poorer health outcomes and high-cost insurance claims (e.g. ER admission, emergency
surgery), both of which add additional costs to the insured and LHIC.
In order for LHIC's care management team to succeed in achieving their goals,
they need to be able to make contact and engage with their high-risk population. One of
the teamâ€™s largest obstacles to succeeding is simply getting their targeted population to
answer the phone and begin a discussion. They have supplied us with data on nearly
300,000 "cases", with data across many demographic and health-related variables, as
well as a few key variables related to engagement. They have requested that we explore,
clean, and analyze their data. LHIC would like our team to create a high-accuracy model
to predict likelihood of engagement based on other member factors.

### Problem Statement:

To allow members of the LHIC care management team focus their outreach on members who are the most likely to engage.

### Our Response:

 - We explored clusters and specific variable relationships associated with high member engagement 
 - We built a variety of machine learning models aimed at predicting likelihood of engaging based on fields mentioned above
 - With an eye on explainability, we tuned a logistic regression model able to predict successful member engagement with 77% accuracy
 - We developed helpful report-generating scripts in Python and wireframed a business intelligence dashboard proof of concept in Tableau
